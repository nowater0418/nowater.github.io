<h1>Map and Food Rating List of Singapore Hawker Centers</h1>
<h3>Project goals</h3>
<p>Information about Singapore's hawker centers, including their locations, stall types, and sizes, is difficult to visually represent on map apps. Even tourists and locals often struggle to locate hawker centers through map navigation, making it time-consuming for users to find their ideal options. This project aims to utilize data visualization to present the distribution, stall types, and sizes of over 50 hawker centers in Singapore. By building interactive features such as filtering and photo display, it helps users make more effective dining decisions.</p >
<h3>Project Process</h3>
<p>1. Collect information about hawker centers in Singapore, including their locations, types of stalls, sizes, and operating hours.</p >
<p>2. Mark hawker centers on a map of Singapore and use colors to distinguish between different size and rating levels (for example, gold for centers with more than 30 stalls and green for centers with 10 or fewer stalls).</p >
<p>3. Add filtering options to allow users to select their preferred criteria (such as proximity to Bedok, golden scale, or specific cuisine, such as Hainanese chicken rice).</p >
<p>4. When the user clicks on a snack center on the map, photos of the overall stall scale, names of all stalls, and detailed addresses will be displayed.</p >
